[ 1 ] The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex . The Cowboys compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East Division . [ 2 ] The Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960 and have played their home games at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas , since 2009 . [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Originally a member of the NFL Western Conference , the team was moved to the NFL Eastern Conference in 1961 after just one season; they remained in this conference until 1970. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 1967 the NFL subdivided the Eastern and Western conferences into divisions, assigning the Cowboys to the NFL Capitol Division . [ 7 ] In 1970, as part of the AFL–NFL merger , the Cowboys were reassigned to the National Football Conference (NFC). In addition to being reassigned conferences, the Cowboys' division, the NFL Capitol Division, was renamed to the NFC East Division. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times, tying it with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos for second-most Super Bowl appearances in history behind the New England Patriots ' record 11 appearances. Of their eight appearances, the Cowboys have won five Super Bowls ( Super Bowls VI , XII , XXVII , XXVIII and XXX ) which is tied for 3rd most in total championships amongst all 32 NFL franchises. [ 4 ] [ 10 ] The Cowboys have won eight NFC championships , tied for most in the conference's history. [ 11 ] The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 consecutive winning seasons (from 1966 to 1985) during which they missed the playoffs only twice (1974 and 1984). [ 3 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The Cowboys have won their division 25 times, the most among the teams in their division. [ 14 ] As of the end of the 2024 season , the Cowboys have accumulated a record of 569 wins, 423 losses, and 6 ties in the regular season, which is the second-best all-time regular season record among active franchises in terms of win–loss percentage. [ 10 ] They have also made the playoffs 36 times, second only to the Green Bay Packers, and have the ninth-best playoff record in terms of win–loss percentage with 36 wins and 31 losses. [ 10 ] [ 15 ] The team has had 40 winning seasons , 19 losing seasons, and 6 seasons with as many wins as losses. [ 13 ] Seasons [ edit ] Tom Landry was the head coach of the Cowboys for 29 seasons. During this time he had 20 consecutive winning seasons, won two Super Bowls, and was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year . Landry was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990 and was unanimously selected as a coach for the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Jimmy Johnson was the head coach of the Cowboys for five seasons. He led the team to three playoff appearances, two division titles, and two Super Bowls. In 2020, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame . [ 19 ] Jason Garrett , a former backup quarterback for the team from 1992 to 1999, was the team's head coach from 2011 to 2019 and the interim head coach for part of the 2010 season .

See also [ edit ] History of the Dallas Cowboys List of Dallas Cowboys first-round draft picks List of Dallas Cowboys head coaches Notes [ edit ] ^ The Cowboys played in the NFL's Western Conference for the 1960 season, but were a "swing team" and played each of the other 12 teams in the league that year. When the Minnesota Vikings joined the league for the 1961 season, the owners of the Eastern Conference teams were allowed to vote on which expansion franchise they wanted to be permanently assigned to their conference. The result was the Cowboys joining the NFL's Eastern Conference. [ 5 ] ^ In 1961, the NFL expanded its regular season schedule, which had been 12 games since 1947, to 14 games. [ 23 ] ^ In 1967, the NFL divided conferences into divisions, resulting in two divisions in each of the two conferences. Up to 1967, the league was either divided into two divisions, two conferences, or neither. [ 7 ] ^ a b In 1970, the NFL and American Football League (AFL) officially merged in the AFL–NFL merger to form one league with two conferences. All ten former AFL teams as well as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Baltimore from the pre-merger NFL joined the AFC; the other thirteen remaining NFL teams joined the NFC. Each of those two were divided into three divisions: East, Central, and West. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] ^ In 1978, the NFL expanded its regular season schedule, which had been 14 games since 1961, to 16 games. [ 23 ] [ 44 ] ^ The 1982 season was shortened to nine games after a players' strike . The top eight teams in each conference advanced to the playoffs. [ 48 ] ^ The 1987 NFL strike caused the schedule to be reduced to 15 games. [ 55 ] ^ In 2002, the NFL realigned to create four divisions in both conferences with four teams in each division. [ 71 ] ^ In 2021, the NFL expanded its regular season schedule, which had been 16 games since 1978, to 17 games. [ 23 ] [ 97 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b Brandt, Gil (May 28, 2009).
